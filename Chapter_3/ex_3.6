Res:

    The idea is to have binary search tree with a doubly linked list for predecesors and succesors. Each node in the tree gets a pointer to the specific entry in the doubly linked list.

         O
     O   |   O
  O  |  O|O  |  O
  |  |  |||  |  |
  V  V  VVV  V  V
  1--2--345--6--7

Search minimum and maximum will work in the same way.
Insert for example, let's say 4 is not inserted. We traverse the list to node 3, and we know that node 4 will be placed on the right. Node 3 refers to entry 3 in the linked list which has succesor node 5. After insertion node 3 will point to node 4, node 4 will point to node 3 and node 5. We update the doubly linked list the same way for deletion. So succesor and predecesor are avaible in O(1), and other operations in O(log n)
