Res:
    1. When array fals below half full, cut in half we have a bad cost when the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0]. If we delete one element, the array will shrink it's size to half, if we add one element the array will double it's size and so on.

    2. Shrink size to half when the array is not at half full, eg array is 1/3 full -> shrink size to half.
