Res:
    1. The struct node will be struct Node{int data, struct Node* next1*, struct Node *next2*, struct Node *parent*}

Overhead fraction, that is data_space / all_space, the tree will be stored in memory as a adjacency list:
4 bytes data, 12bytes pointers-> 4/12+4=1/4

    2. In a binary tree with n nodes, there are (n+1)/2 leafs nodes
4((n+1)/2) = 2n+2 bytes data, 4(n-(n+1)/2) = 2n-2 bytes pointers

2n+2/4n = n+1/2n->1/2(n->00)
